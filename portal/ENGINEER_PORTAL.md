## Fractal Hiring Spa — Engineer Portal

### Product Functionality Summary

**What it is:** An AI-powered job matching platform that analyzes engineers' actual work (GitHub, portfolio) and personal priorities to surface the jobs they're most likely to love — scored across 5 dimensions with full transparency on *why* each job matches.

#### The 3-Step Engineer Journey

**Step 1: Onboarding & Profile Analysis**
- Magic link login (no passwords)
- Engineers share GitHub, portfolio, LinkedIn, and resume URLs
- System automatically crawls repos, languages, stars, and portfolio content
- Claude synthesizes everything into an "Engineer DNA" profile: top skills, frameworks, seniority signal, project highlights
- Crawling runs in the background — engineers can proceed immediately

**Step 2: Questionnaire & Priorities**
- 5 sections covering work preferences, career growth, strengths, growth areas, and deal breakers
- 4 priority ratings (1–5): work-life balance, culture, mission-driven work, technical challenges
- Claude generates a structured profile summary combining GitHub data + questionnaire answers
- ~5 minutes to complete

**Step 3: Smart Job Matching**
- Hundreds of active jobs scored against the engineer's complete profile
- Each job scored across 5 dimensions (0–100):
  - **Mission** — Does the company's purpose align with what drives you?
  - **Technical** — Does the role use and grow your skills?
  - **Culture** — Will you enjoy working with these people?
  - **Environment** — Remote/office, team size, autonomy — does it fit how you work?
  - **DNA** — Career trajectory: step up, lateral, or step down?
- Weighted by the engineer's own priority ratings
- Only jobs scoring 40+ on every dimension make the cut
- Top 10 shown with overall score, highlight quote, per-dimension breakdown, and reasoning

#### Feedback Loop
- "I Applied" tracking for weekly application counts
- "Not a Fit" with categorized reasons (wrong location, wrong stack, company not interesting, seniority mismatch)
- One-click exclusion rules: "Don't show me jobs in [city]" or "Exclude [company]"
- Feedback is analyzed and used in future match reasoning

#### Dashboard & Profile Management
- At-a-glance stats: total matches, weekly applications, profile status
- Profile completion banners guiding engineers through each step
- Edit questionnaire anytime to trigger fresh matching
- Manage all exclusion rules in one place
- Email notifications when matches are ready

#### How It Works

1. **Share your links.** We analyze your GitHub, portfolio, and LinkedIn to understand your technical strengths and work style. No manual skill entry — your code speaks for itself.

2. **Tell us what matters.** A 5-minute questionnaire on work preferences, growth areas, and deal breakers. Not a lengthy assessment — just what we need to match you well.

3. **See your top matches.** We score hundreds of jobs across 5 dimensions and show you the ones you're most likely to love. With transparent reasoning for every score.

#### Key Differentiators

**AI that reads your code, not your keywords.**
Your GitHub is your real resume. We crawl your repos, analyze your languages and contributions, and build a technical profile grounded in what you've actually built.

**5 dimensions, not 1.**
Most job boards match on title and keywords. We evaluate mission alignment, technical fit, culture, work environment, and career trajectory — because engineers evaluate opportunities the same way.

**Transparent scoring.**
Every match shows its work. See per-dimension scores, specific reasoning, and a highlight quote explaining the fit. No black boxes.

**You stay in control.**
Not interested in a city, company, or tech stack? One click to exclude them. Change your priorities anytime — matches recompute automatically. Feedback on past matches improves future ones.

**No spam, no waste.**
We'd rather show you 8 real fits than 50 middling jobs. Every match clears a quality threshold across all 5 dimensions before it reaches you.

#### Benefits
- No more scrolling job boards — we do the analysis
- See *why* each job matched, not just a percentage
- Feedback improves future matches — the system learns from you
- Matches update when your preferences change
- From sign-up to matched in ~10 minutes
