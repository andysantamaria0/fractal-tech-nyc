## Messaging Principles

1. **Professional tone** — speak to adults making a serious career investment, not students enrolling in school
2. **Lead with outcomes** — $100K+ salaries, 12-week placement, named companies
3. **Show proof** — alumni stories with real names, real numbers, real companies
4. **Emphasize what's different** — internships (not projects), staff-level instructors (not TAs), in-person NYC (not online)
5. **Address AI head-on** — position the program as the way to be on the right side of the AI shift
6. **Confidence, not desperation** — the audience is capable, they just need the right environment and network
